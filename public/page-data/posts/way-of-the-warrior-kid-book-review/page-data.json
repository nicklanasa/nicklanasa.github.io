As a kid, you want to have fun and acting like a warrior sounds it wouldn’t be the first choice for any kid. Forunately, after reading this book, I’m fully endorsing that every kid should be warrior kid and eventually, they will realize that too. Let me explain. </p>\n<p>This book is all about a kid named Marc that was having a hard time at school. He felt weak, unintelligent and was often bullied by the “bigger” kid Kenny. One particular part in the book that stood out was when all the kids in his gym class had to do 10 pullups in front of the entire class. Most of the kids could do more than one but Marc couldn’t do any. This did not help his self esteem and also gave the bully Kenny more ammunition. </p>\n<p>When the school year ended, Marc was not feeling so great about himself. He felt alone and not capable of doing anything to prevent the problems he had at school but little did he know this was all about to change. His Navy Seal Uncle Jake came to visit for the summer, who was about to give Marc a whole new outlook on his life and obstacles he encountered. </p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/Navy-seal-jake.png\" alt=\"Warrior Kid\"></p>\n<p>Marc was clearly impressed with Uncle Jake because he looked like he had everything figured out. Uncle Jake quickly saw that Marc was going through a rough patch and offered his help which Marc reluctantly agreed. Throughout the summer, Uncle Jake systematically showed Marc that the problems he had were easily solved with two things: <strong>Discipline</strong> and <strong>Hard Work</strong>. </p>\n<p>It all started with explaining to Marc that he needed a <em>code</em>. A <em>code</em> for himself to live by, just like the Navy Seals had and countless other warriors in history. Over the course of the summer, Marc would learn many lesson that would turn into his own <em>code</em>. This concept of a <em>code</em> was particular eye opening for me. Being a professional software engineer, working with code is something that I truly enjoy doing so developing my own code that I would live by was something I definitely wanted to do. Especially, because I wanted to set great example for my daughter.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I realized that to be best person I wanted to be, I needed to developed my own code to live by. This was obviously essential for teaching my daughter that she could be the best person she wanted to be by developing her own code. Leading by example, parenting 101. Duh.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, one by one, Uncle Jake took Marc’s problem and showed him tactics that he could use to solve them. Couldn’t do 10 pullups, Uncle Jake and Marc started to <strong>wake up early</strong> and <strong>workout</strong>. Eventually, Marc got strong enough to do more pullups than he thought he could ever do.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/Marc-pullups.png\" alt=\"Marc times tables\"></p>\n<p>Marc had problems in his math class, he didn’t know his times tables. So, Uncle Jake taught him how to use flash cards and <strong>repetition</strong> to memorize them. Then, timed him and made him do it faster so that he could recall them almost instantly. </p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/Marc-times-tables.png\" alt=\"Marc times tables\"></p>\n<p>Being bullied at school, Uncle Jake and Marc started to train <strong>Jui-Jitsu</strong>. Marc quickly learned that <strong>technique</strong> will always trump size. This quickly showed that there is no reason to be scared of Kenny the bully at school who was much bigger than he was.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/Marc-tap-out.png\" alt=\"Marc tap out\"></p>\n<p>Marc was scared to swim because he never learned. Uncle Jake showed him that with enough practice, he could swim and swim well. Eventually, Marc got so good, he jumped off a bridge into the lake that he learned to swim in!</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/Marc-swim-bridge.png\" alt=\"Marc swim\"></p>\n<p>Jumping off the bridge was something Marc was very scared to do. He was full of fear and didn’t know how to overcome this. Uncle Jake said something to him that I feel I’m going to remember forever, it went something like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Fear is normal. In fact, fear is good and that you need to learn to control it. The first part of that is preparation then you have to just “GO”. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He explained the fear lives in the moment and that it’s a powerful moment but once you “GO”, once you start, you won’t be afraid anymore.</p>\n<p>I’m sure you get the trend here. Over and over, Marc realized that with <strong>Discipline</strong> and <strong>Hard Work</strong>, he could overcome anything. When he went back to school after summer was over, his first day back was one of the best days of school he ever had. He aced his math test, did more pullups than everybody except for one person in his class and had an encounter with the big bully Kenny that ended up with them becoming friends because he stood up to him due to his new found confidence from training <strong>Jui-Jitsu</strong>. The other kids in his class realized that Marc had changed for the better and they wanted to know how he did it. Now, it was time for Marc to lead by example and pass along what he learned about becoming a WARRIOR KID and the <em>code</em> he lived by.</p>\n<p>I think this book was particular enjoyable for me because I’m a father. I feel that it’s my obligation to set an example for my daughter. Showing her with the right amount of <strong>Hard Work</strong> and <strong>Discipline</strong>, you can achieve anything. Your problems don’t need to exist forever, you can overcome them and lead other people to believe the same thing.</p>\n<p>Now it’s time for me to solidify my own WARRIOR code so that my daughter can maybe model her’s off mine.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/way-of-the-warrior-kid-book-review","tagSlugs":["/tag/book-reviews/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-03-14","description":"Book Review - WAY of the WARRIOR KID by Jocko Willink","tags":["Book reviews"],"title":"Book Review - WAY of the WARRIOR KID","socialImage":"/media/Warrior-kid.png"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/way-of-the-warrior-kid-book-review"}}}
