Here are some of my personal projects, most of them are not in development anymore but all the code is public. 

I'm an emacs user, so here is my configuration. It's pretty clean and could easily be copied from.

* [Emacs config](https://github.com/nicklanasa/emacs)
* [Xcode mode for emacs](https://github.com/nicklanasa/xcode-mode)
* [Muz - iOS music player with last.fm integration](https://github.com/nicklanasa/Muz)
* [Wormhole - iOS full featured reddit client](https://github.com/nicklanasa/Wormhole) - still on iOS app store
